# zcode-beautify

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Beautify the **ZCode desktop client**: use any image as a background wallpaper and adapt the whole UI with Material Design 3 (Monet) dynamic color — plus a live settings panel for real-time tuning.

> 📷 Screenshot welcome — PRs adding one to `docs/screenshot.png` are appreciated.

## Features

- **Wallpaper** — any local image becomes a fixed background layer behind the UI, with three framing modes: `cover` (fill and crop), `contain` (letterboxed over a blurred backdrop of the same picture), and `smart` — a local AI-style analysis that finds the salient subject and picks the best framing and focus point automatically.
- **Monet theming** — a source color is extracted from the wallpaper with Google's official MD3 algorithm; light/dark palettes are mapped onto ZCode's semantic CSS variables (35+ tokens).
- **Live settings panel** — a draggable panel inside ZCode with blur/dim sliders, Monet and wallpaper-visibility toggles, one-click wallpaper swap, and reset. Changes preview instantly and persist.
- **Conversation control** — bundled slash command `/beautify` and MCP tools let the ZCode agent set the wallpaper or tune the theme on your behalf.
- **Survives restarts** — the injected theme dies with the renderer on every ZCode restart, so the plugin puts it back: `on-start` (default) has the MCP host restore it when ZCode starts, `always` keeps a background service alive so the theme *and* the settings panel survive a reboot. Choose either in the settings panel.

## How it works

ZCode is an Electron app whose UI theming is driven by Tailwind v4 `--color-*` CSS custom properties, and production builds start **without** a debug port. This plugin:

1. starts ZCode with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` (one-time `launch`);
2. connects over the Chrome DevTools Protocol and injects CSS/JS into the renderer:
   - a fixed-position wallpaper layer (image embedded as data URI),
   - translucent background variables so the wallpaper shows through,
   - MD3 light/dark palettes overriding ZCode's semantic tokens;
3. keeps the injection sessions open (`serve`) so the theme and the settings panel survive renderer reloads.

It never modifies ZCode's installation files, so ZCode upgrades are unaffected.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 20 available on your PATH.
- ZCode desktop client (Windows / macOS / Linux).

## Two packages, both installable by handing an AI the link

Give your AI agent just <https://github.com/SXC6/ZCodeBeauty> — it
clones the repo and follows the instructions inside. Pick the right one:

| | **Plugin package** (`INSTALL-FOR-AI.md`) | **Skill pack** (`skill-pack/SKILL.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| Target | The **ZCode desktop client** | **Any** Electron app |
| AI's role | Installer — sets up the ready-made plugin | Developer — builds the tool from scratch |
| You say | "Install this beautify plugin in my ZCode" | "Build wallpaper/color beautification for my XX app" |
| Result | Working `/beautify` command + MCP tools | A new local beautify tool |

Copy-paste prompt for the plugin:

```text
https://github.com/SXC6/ZCodeBeauty
Install this beautify plugin into my ZCode desktop client. Follow
INSTALL-FOR-AI.md in the repository.
```

Offline? Both packages are attached to the
[releases page](https://github.com/SXC6/ZCodeBeauty/releases) as zips.

## Install (manual paths)

### Option A — ZCode plugin marketplace (recommended)

1. Open ZCode → **Settings → Plugin Management → Discover**.
2. Click **+** and add this repository (GitHub URL or a local clone path).
3. Click **Get** on the *zcode-beautify* card. The `/beautify` command and MCP tools are available immediately.

The published repo ships prebuilt single-file bundles in `dist/`, so no build step is needed on your machine.

### Option B — clone and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SXC6/ZCodeBeauty.git
cd ZCodeBeauty
node dist/cli.js --help        # prebuilt bundle, zero install
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Quit ZCode completely, then start it with the CDP debug port (one-time).
node dist/cli.js launch

# 2) Set a wallpaper with Monet adaptation
node dist/cli.js apply "D:\pictures\wallpaper.jpg" --blur 6 --dim 30

# 3) Persist the debug port into every launch entry, so starting ZCode normally
#    still opens it. Entries needing admin rights are reported and skipped.
node dist/cli.js repair-launchers

# 4) Choose what restores the theme after a restart.
#    on-start (default) = no resident process, no settings panel.
#    always             = background service; theme + panel survive a reboot.
node dist/cli.js recovery on-start

# 5) Only needed for `on-start`: get the live settings panel now.
#    --detach backgrounds it, so the panel keeps working after this shell
#    (or the agent session that started it) is gone.
node dist/cli.js serve --detach
```

With `serve` running, a 🎨 button appears in the bottom-right corner of ZCode. Open it to tune blur/dim live, cycle the framing mode (cover → contain → smart), toggle Monet colors or wallpaper translucency, swap the wallpaper image, or reset — everything previews instantly and is saved automatically. The 叠加颜色 button opens a palette docked beside the panel: pick a color (SV square, hue bar, sixteen quick preset chips, or type R/G/B values), set the overlay strength (1-100%, never 0 — turning the overlay off is what 重置 / right-click do), and the readout shows exactly what will apply, e.g. `#FFFFFF (255,255,255) 0%` when no overlay is active. The panel chrome follows ZCode's own light/dark theme. If the service is not running, the panel shows an explicit ⚠ offline banner instead of a zeroed configuration.

You can also just type `/beautify <image path>` in ZCode and let the agent do it, then say things like "make it blurrier" (handled by the `apply_options` MCP tool).

## CLI reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `launch [--port N]` | Start ZCode with `--remote-debugging-port` (quit ZCode first) |
| `apply <image> [--blur] [--dim] [--fit] [--no-monet]` | Set wallpaper + adapt colors (`--fit cover\|contain\|smart`) |
| `colors [--port N] [--transparency <0-100>]` | Re-apply the stored theme; `--transparency` tunes overall UI translucency (50 = default); `--overlay-color <#rrggbb\|none>` and `--overlay-strength <1-100>` control the wallpaper tint |
| `serve [--detach] [--api-port M]` | Watch mode + settings panel + local control API (default API port 9223); `--detach` survives the shell that started it |
| `watch` | Headless watch mode: re-inject whenever ZCode restarts |
| `recovery [off\|on-start\|always]` | How the theme comes back after a restart (default `on-start`) |
| `autostart [install\|uninstall]` | Register the resident service to start at sign-in (used by `always`) |
| `repair-launchers [--dry-run]` | Add `--remote-debugging-port` to every launch entry missing it; creates a `ZCode (Beautified)` desktop shortcut when no per-user shortcut has the flag |
| `reset` | Remove wallpaper and color overrides |
| `status` | Show CDP reachability and renderer targets |

## MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `set_background` | Set wallpaper + Monet colors |
| `apply_options` | Tune blur/dim/monet/wallpaper visibility/framing/UI translucency and the wallpaper overlay (color + strength) without re-sending the image |
| `refresh_theme` | Re-inject the stored theme after a restart |
| `reset_appearance` | Remove wallpaper and overrides |
| `beautify_status` | Show the stored config |
| `recovery_status` | Report the recovery mode, autostart entry and CDP reachability |
| `set_recovery_mode` | Switch between `off` / `on-start` / `always` |
| `repair_launchers` | Add the debug-port flag to launch entries missing it; guarantees a working per-user shortcut |

User data lives in `~/.zcode/cli/plugins/data/zcode-beautify/`: `config.json`
(live configuration), `config.backup.json` (what 还原/Reset remembers for
restore), and `wallpaper.*` (a copy of your image so the theme survives the
original file moving or being deleted).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build    # type-check + compile to dist/
npm run bundle   # prebuilt single-file bundles (what the repo ships)
```

`dist/` is committed so users never need to build. If you change `src/`, run `npm run bundle` and commit the updated bundles.

## Skill pack (`skill-pack/`)

`skill-pack/` is a self-contained, platform-agnostic skill for AI coding agents
(Claude, DeepSeek, Codex, Doubao, …): hand the folder to any agent and it can
rebuild this beautify capability for **any** Electron app — the CDP plumbing,
MD3 color extraction, injection templates, live-tuning API, and the pitfall
list gathered from production. Versioned together with this repo. Grab it from
the [releases page](https://github.com/SXC6/ZCodeBeauty/releases) as a
zip, or read [`skill-pack/SKILL.md`](skill-pack/SKILL.md) directly.

## Risks & limitations

- Injection happens over CDP — an **unofficial** mechanism. Updates to ZCode may break it; `reset` always restores the default look.
- ZCode only opens its debug port when it is started with `--remote-debugging-port`, and an instance that is already running can never grow one — the flag has to come from the launcher. `repair-launchers` writes it into every launch entry it can reach (desktop, Start Menu, pinned taskbar, the `zcode://` handler and the context-menu verbs); machine-wide entries need administrator rights and are reported instead.
- **Two entries lose the flag again on their own.** ZCode's updater rebuilds the Start Menu shortcut (the flag goes with it), and the app re-registers its protocol and context-menu registry handlers on every start, restoring those values. The shortcut copies are the durable entries — and most third-party launchers (Flow Launcher, PowerToys Run, …) index the Start Menu shortcut and start it through ShellExecute, so the flag there covers them too. If the theme disappears after an update: run `repair-launchers`, then quit ZCode completely and start it from a repaired shortcut. In `on-start` mode (default) the plugin also repairs the entries by itself when it finds the port unreachable at startup — restarting once is then enough.
- The injected theme lives in the renderer and is lost on every ZCode restart. `on-start` (default) restores it once when ZCode starts; `always` keeps the resident `serve` daemon alive so the theme and the settings panel both survive. A foreground `serve` dies with the terminal (or agent session) that spawned it — use `serve --detach`, or let `always` manage it.
- Functional colors (success/warning/destructive) are intentionally left untouched.
- The control API binds to `127.0.0.1` and requires a token that only the injected panel carries, so a stray local process — or a web page open in a local browser — cannot drive it.
